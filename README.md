##Listen to Events
In order to listen to event you need to attache the event listener to the extension dispatcher.
The easiest way is to create an internal dispatcher instance:
```javascript
/**
 * Extension event dispatcher instance
 **/
private function get dispatcher():EventDispatcher
{
    // Return the extension dispatcher
    return adMobManager.dispatcher;
}
```

Then you can add all the listener for the event you need:
```javascript
// onBannerLoaded Event Listener
if (!dispatcher.hasEventListener(AdMobEvent.BANNER_LOADED))
    dispatcher.addEventListener(AdMobEvent.BANNER_LOADED, onBannerLoaded);


/**
 * onBannerLoaded Event listener
 *
 * @param e AdMobEvent Object
 **/
static private function onBannerLoaded(e:AdMobEvent):void
{
    // Do Something like show the banner...
    adMobManager.showAllBanner();
}
```

The event will also pass the banner id for the banner who did dispatch the event.
The example above will show all the banner, if you wish to, for example, show only
the specific banner who did dispatch the event you can do as follow:

```javascript
/**
 * onBannerLoaded Event listener
 *
 * @param e AdMobEvent Object
 **/
static private function onBannerLoaded(e:AdMobEvent):void
{
    // Show the specific banner who did dispatch the event
    // e.data:String = Banner unique ID
    adMobManager.showBanner(e.data);
}
```

One of the most important characteristic of Admob ANE Extension is that
it was develop aimed to allow multiple banner instance to be used and managed while
available in cache. For this reason all the event will always pass the Banner id s parameter.
This include also the error Event.
If you need to check the error events details simply set the verbose mode to "true" then all the
details will be available in the console logs.

The Extension available Event are as follow:
```javascript
BANNER_LOADED // The banner has been received and it is ready to be show
BANNER_FAILED_TO_LOAD // There was an error with the banner request. most of the time, it is a wrong adMobId or missing connection
BANNER_AD_OPENED // The banner has been clicked by the user
BANNER_AD_CLOSED // The User left the banner destination (webpage/store) and is returning to the application
BANNER_LEFT_APPLICATION // The banner has been remove from the application
INTERSTITIAL_LOADED // The Interstitial has been received and it is ready to be show (iOS will be show directly)
INTERSTITIAL_FAILED_TO_LOAD // There was an error with the Interstitial request. most of the time, it is a wrong adMobId or missing connection
INTERSTITIAL_AD_OPENED // The Interstitial has been clicked by the user
INTERSTITIAL_AD_CLOSED // The Interstitial has been remove from the application (especially useful for listen when the user close the Interstitial)
INTERSTITIAL_LEFT_APPLICATION // The User left the Interstitial destination (webpage/store) and is returning to the application
```
